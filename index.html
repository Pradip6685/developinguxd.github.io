    <p class="alert alert-success vgap"><strong>Congratulations!</strong> You decided on learning modern frontend techniques. You cannot imagine, how proud we are! Soon you will be building interative prototypes like a pro. And all the frontend developers around you will love you.</p>

      <p>We suggest installing the following applications so we all have the same setup. That makes explaining much easier.</p>
      <p class="alert alert-info"><strong>You should use a Mac. </strong>Yes, we know that a PC can be a great machine. But for modern frontend development, it is much easier on a Mac (or on Linux). Many programming languages, apps and libs have way better support and there are a few applications that are very helpful that only exist for machines running OS X (the operating system running on your Mac).
      </p>
      <h1 class="h2">Install Google Chrome</h1>
       <p>First, we need a modern browser. The current best choice is <a href="{{page.urls.chrome}}" target="_blank">Google Chrome</a>. It is a very advanced, quick and robust browser. It has great built-in development tools, that are very helpful speeding up the development process.</p>
       <h2 class="h4">Recommended extensions for Google Chrome</h2>

         <dt><a href="{{page.urls.chrome-responsive}}">Responsive Inspector</a></dt>
         <dd>Look how a website looks in the different browser widths defined by the developer</dd>
         <dt><a href="{{page.urls.chrome-bootstrap-offline}}">Bootstrap 3 Offline Guide</a></dt>
         <dd>The full Bootstrap 3 documentation saved in your browser. No internet connection needed to stay productive!</dd>
         <dt><a href="{{page.urls.chrome-jetstrap}}">Jetstrap</a></dt>
         <dd>Graphical editor for Bootstrap. Not without flaws, but interesting enough to fiddle around a bit.</dd>
       </dl>
       <p></p>
      <h1 class="h2">Install Sublime Text 3</h1>
       <p>There are a lot of great text editors out there. This one is very fast, very popular and there are a lot of great extensions. We will use a few of them.  You can install the free (and endless) beta of <a href="{{page.urls.subl}}">Sublime Text 3 here</a>.</p>
