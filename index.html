  <p>With HTML5 and modern browsers, it's easier than ever to develop basic frontend coding skills. This page will help you get up and running in <em>no time</em>. <a href="#register">Don't miss our launch!</a></p>

  <h2>Why this is important for you</h2>
  <p>Deep in your heart you know that the tools you are using are crap and the whole process of creating websites and apps sucks: <strong>You build wireframes and prototypes that are thrown away</strong>, because nobody wants to update them when the design process started. And the design? Let's face it: It's a static fake that doesn't resemble the final product. And you know what? As soon as development starts, it's outdated as well.</p>
  <p>There is just one way to get it right and you know the one who is going to fix that for your company:</p>
  <p><strong>You.</strong></p>
  <p>And how?</p>
  <p><strong>By finally learning how to code.</strong></p>
