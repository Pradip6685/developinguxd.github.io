  <h1 class="main-headline">Why you are here</h1>
  <p>You are a <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience_design" target="_blank">User Experience Designer</a>. Let's say an Information Architect, a Visual Designer or something in that direction.</p>

  <p>You have some tools you use for your daily work to create wireframes and stuff like that and you are pretty used to them and there is nothing better right now and in a few months they say, there will be a new version of that one tool and it will produce finally better HTML and so on.</p>

  <p>Look at yourself. You know that those tools suck. You know that the whole process you are involved in sucks! There is just one way to get it right and only one person in your bureau who can fix that:</p>

  <p><strong>You.</strong></p>

  <p>And how?</p>

  <p><strong>By finally learning how to code.</strong></p>

  <p><em>&ldquo;But I am not a developer&rdquo;</em> &mdash; stop right there. You don't have to be a developer to learn that bit of HTML and CSS. It's not even considered &ldquo;coding&rdquo; by real developers.</p>

  <p>Let us take you by the hand and show you everything you need to know to become a <em>good enough</em> coder to create your wireframes and prototypes in HTML.</p>

  <p>Now just wait until the end of May 2014, when we launch this learning platform. See you there!</p>
