    <p class="alert alert-success vgap"><strong>Congratulations!</strong> You decided on learning modern frontend techniques. You cannot imagine, how proud we are! Soon you will be building interative prototypes like a pro. And all the frontend developers around you will love you.</p>

      <p>We suggest installing the following applications so we all have the same setup. That makes explaining much easier.</p>
      <p class="alert alert-info"><strong>You should use a Mac.</strong> Yes, we know that a PC can be a great machine. But for modern frontend development, it is much easier on a Mac (or on Linux). Many programming languages, apps and libs have way better support and there are a few applications that are very helpful that only exist for machines running OS X (the operating system running on your Mac).

      <h1 class="h2">Install Google Chrome</h1>
       <p>First, we need a modern browser. The current best choice is <a href="{{page.url.chrome}}" target="_blank">Google Chrome</a>. It is a very advanced, quick and robust browser. It has great built-in development tools, that are very helpful speeding up the development process.</p>
