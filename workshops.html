  <h1>Workshop "Developing UXD"</h1>
  <p>We just came back from Berlin, where we hosted the <strong>biggest workshop of the "IA Konferenz 2014"</strong>. What a blast! Special thanks go to Stephen Köver from the local team, who helped a lot getting everything we needed for the workshop.</p>

  <h2>Here are the slides</h2>
  {% include _workshop_slides.html %}

  <p>16 UX Designers (some of them with no frontend knowledge at all) wrapped their heads about the basics and best practices of HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.</p>
  <p>We got the feedback, that this was a great start for becoming a "Coding UX Designer", but we all know that &mdash; of course &mdash; the biggest chunk of work is still ahead of us. Follow us on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/developinguxd" target="_blank">Twitter</a>  to get updates or even like us on <a href="https://facebook.com/developinguxd" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, to participate in the discussion about our project!</p>
