  <h1>Workshop "Developing UXD"</h1>
  <p>We just came back from Berlin, where we hosted the biggest workshop of the "IA Konferenz 2014".</p>
  <p>16 UX Designers (some of them with no frontend knowledge at all) wrapped their heads about the basics and best practices of HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.</p>
  <p>We got the feedback, that this was a great start for becoming a "Coding UX Designer", but we all know that &mdash; of course &mdash; the biggest chunk of work is still ahead of us. Follow us on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/developinguxd" target="_blank">Twitter</a> or join us on <a href="https://facebook.com/developinguxd" target="_blank">Facebook</a> to get updates about our project!</p>

  <p>If you are also interested in getting started with "Developing UXD", feel free to <a href="contact.html">contact us</a>.</p>
